Revision history for Setup-File-Symlink

0.07    2011-04-27

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Increase robustness, each step now also checks state and skips if
          desired state already reached. This means that undo can be reapplied
          without erroring. We cannot guarantee state changes between invocation
          of do and undo anyway, so we try our best at each step.
